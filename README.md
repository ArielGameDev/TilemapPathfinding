# Unity week 5: Two-dimensional scene-building and path-finding

A project with step-by-step scenes illustrating how to construct a 2D scene using tilemaps,
and how to do path-finding using the BFS algorithm.

Text explanations are available 
[here](https://github.com/gamedev-at-ariel/gamedev-5782) in folder 07.

## Cloning
To clone the project, you may need to install git lfs first:
